## ZSH and oh-my-zsh - Make bash more intuitive and usefull

> ZSH also called the Z shell, is an extended version of the Bourne Shell (sh), with plenty of new features, and support for plugins and themes. Since itâ€™s based on the same shell as Bash, ZSH has many of the same features, and switching over is a breeze.

Install `ZSH` and `Oh-My-ZSH` (freamwork for easly manage zsh - additional plugins and themes):

```Bash
brew install zsh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)" #install Oh-My-ZSH
```

## Add auto suggestions and shell syntax highlight

You have to install two plugins: `zsh-autosuggestions` and `zsh-syntax-highlighting`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
vim ~/.zshrc
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

Now, you can add it to your zsh config file `~/.zshrc`.

```bash
plugins=(git zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting)
```

## Running multiple commands in one line in shell

- `|` pipes (pipelines) the standard output (stdout) of one command into the standard input of another one. Note that stderr still goes into its default destination, whatever that happen to be.
- `|&` pipes both stdout and stderr of one command into the standard input of another one. Very useful, available in bash version 4 and above.
- `&&` executes the right-hand command of && only if the previous one succeeded.
- `||` executes the right-hand command of || only it the previous one failed.
- `;` executes the right-hand command of ; always regardless whether the previous command succeeded or failed. Unless set -e was previously invoked, which causes bash to fail on an error.

## Create folder even exists

`mkdir -p` would not give you an error if the directory already exists and the contents for the directory will not change.

```
mkdir -p folder_name
```
