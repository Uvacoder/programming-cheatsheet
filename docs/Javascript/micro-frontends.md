# Micro Frontends

Netflix, PayPal, and Amex have implemented this architecture approach in some of their systems. I’m convinced that this is the right path for micro-frontends maturity.

The community started to have more mature tools like Single-SPA or Module Federation for client-side rendering applications but we are still finding “the way” on the server-side rendering.

With high modularity comes higher complexity that adds a lot overhead work for system operations. Some well known companies have successfully implemented micro frontends and have shared their experiences and open-sourced their tools.

Single SPA - 35.9 %
